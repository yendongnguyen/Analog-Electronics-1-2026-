When the temperature increases from 25°C to 75°C, the diode forward voltage decreases, allowing the diode to conduct at a lower voltage. 
This occurs because higher temperature increases the intrinsic carrier concentration and saturation current. 
In addition, the reverse leakage current increases significantly with temperature. 
These effects are important in real electronic systems because temperature changes can cause bias point shifts, higher power dissipation, and reliability issues if not properly accounted for in design.
