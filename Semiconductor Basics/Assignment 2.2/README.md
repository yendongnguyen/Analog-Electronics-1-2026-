# Assignment 2.2 – LTspice DC Sweep (Diode I–V)

Dong Nguyen

DC Sweep:
V1 swept from 0 V to 5 V with a step of 0.01 V.

Description:
The plot shows the I–V characteristic of the diode, where the current remains near zero at low voltage and increases rapidly after the forward voltage of about 0.7 V.
