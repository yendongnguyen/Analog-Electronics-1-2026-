The Zener diode maintains the output voltage close to 10 V when the load resistance is high (100kΩ and 10kΩ).

However, when the load resistance becomes small (1kΩ), the current required by the load exceeds the available current from the series resistor.

As a result, the Zener diode leaves its breakdown region, and the output voltage drops significantly.

Therefore, the Zener diode can regulate voltage only if sufficient current is available.
