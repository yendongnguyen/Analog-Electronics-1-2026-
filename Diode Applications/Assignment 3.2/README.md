### Behaviour analysis
- Vin is a sinusoidal signal with 100V peak at 50Hz.
- The circuit performs full-wave rectification: negative half cycles are flipped positive.
- Ripple frequency = 2 * fin = 100Hz.
- Because R2 and R3 form a voltage divider (2.2k / 2.2k),
  Vout_peak ≈ 0.5 * Vin_peak ≈ 50V, which matches the simulation.
