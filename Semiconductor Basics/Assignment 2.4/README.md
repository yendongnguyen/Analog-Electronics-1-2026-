Ideal diode conducts immediately with nearly zero forward voltage, while the practical diode (1N4148) requires approximately 0.6–0.7 V before significant current flows. The ideal model simplifies analysis and is useful for conceptual understanding and early design stages. However, it becomes inaccurate when precise voltage levels and power dissipation are important, making practical models necessary in real applications.
