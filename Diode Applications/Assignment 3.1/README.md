Assignment 3.1 - Dong Nguyen

Short Reflection
In this assignment, I learned how diodes work in basic electrical circuits. I learned how to use simple diode models, such as the ideal diode model and the silicon diode model. I also learned how to use Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law to calculate voltage and current step by step.

I learned how to check if a diode is forward-biased or reverse-biased. This helped me understand when current can flow in the circuit. I also learned that a silicon diode usually has a voltage drop of about 0.7 V, and this affects the current value in the circuit.

The main difficulty for me was understanding the direction of current and the polarity of voltage sources. Circuits with negative voltage were especially confusing at first. After practicing more exercises, I became more careful and more confident when solving these problems.

Overall, this assignment helped me understand diodes better and improved my basic circuit analysis skills.
