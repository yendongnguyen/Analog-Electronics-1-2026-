## Question 8  
**Define electricity and electronics in your own words. Highlight the key differences between the two terms.**

**Electricity** is the study and use of electric energy, mainly focusing on the generation, transmission, and utilization of electrical power. It deals with high voltages and large currents used to supply energy for lighting, heating, motors, and industrial machines.

**Electronics** is the study and application of electronic devices and circuits that control the flow of electrons to process information or signals. It usually works with low voltages and small currents and focuses on components such as diodes, transistors, and integrated circuits.

**Key Differences:**
- **Purpose:**  
  - Electricity: Power generation and energy usage  
  - Electronics: Signal processing and control  
- **Voltage/Current Levels:**  
  - Electricity: High voltage, high current  
  - Electronics: Low voltage, low current  
- **Main Components:**  
  - Electricity: Generators, transformers, motors  
  - Electronics: Diodes, transistors, ICs  
- **Applications:**  
  - Electricity: Power grids, home wiring  
  - Electronics: Computers, phones, control systems

## Question 9  
**Choose a specific electronic device or system and explain how electronics contribute to its functionality. Highlight the role of electronic components.**

**Example Device: Smartphone**

A smartphone is a complex electronic system that relies heavily on electronics to function. Electronics allow the phone to process data, communicate wirelessly, display images, and manage power efficiently.

**Key Electronic Components and Their Roles:**
- **Processor (CPU):** Executes instructions and processes data for apps and system operations.  
- **Memory (RAM & Flash):** Stores temporary and permanent data such as apps, photos, and the operating system.  
- **Sensors (camera sensor, accelerometer, proximity sensor):** Collect real-world data and convert it into electrical signals.  
- **Power Management IC (PMIC):** Regulates battery voltage and distributes power to different components.  
- **RF Modules (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Cellular):** Enable wireless communication.  
- **Display Driver IC:** Controls how images and text appear on the screen.

Electronics integrate all these components into a compact system that can communicate, compute, and interact with users.
