Diode selection justification
The 1N5819 reverse voltage rating is 40 V, large enough to cover the entire range of the input voltage, from 12 V, and it has an average forward current rating of 1 A, which is generally enough for low to medium load currents in simple electronic circuits.
The 1N5819 has a small voltage drop of 0.3 to 0.5 V. This reduces the power loss, increasing efficiency, which is useful in the design of the power input protection circuit where a small voltage drop is desired.
The diode is inexpensive, readily available, and commonly used in power protection circuits, which is good for learning and practical use.
The simulation using the LTspice software confirmed the functionality of the diode as the output voltage is 11.6 V when the input is 12 V, which is the voltage drop of a Schottky diode.
